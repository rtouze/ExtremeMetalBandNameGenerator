    <p>It's just a joke! Actually I do love death metal. See this as a free public service if you have no imagination for an awesome band name. Remember to check if the name is not already taken before adopting it.</p>
    <p>I stole most of the pictures and inspiration from French webzine <a href="https://nihilistic-webzine-distro.fr" target="_blank">nihilistic-webzine-distro.fr</a>. You'll get the band of the name in picture filename, go read their <a href="https://nihilistic-webzine-distro.fr/Interviews/interviews.htm" target="blank">interviews</a> and listen to their music!

    <p>It's clearly a copyright infringement, if it's actually problem, please send me an <a href="mailto:contact-blog@zalem.xyz">email</a>.</p>
    <p>I found the fonts on <a href="https://dafont.com" target="_blank">dafont.com</a>.</p>
    <p>If you're done, go back and <a href="/">generate more band names</a>!</p>
